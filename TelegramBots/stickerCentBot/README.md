# stickerCentBot

Setup is similar to wordCentBot, with admin commands. See the adminCommands function in the code to see the available commands. When an admin of the chatgroup responds with "👍" to a sticker, the person who posted that sticker (and their referral chain) are awarded points. If two admins respond with "👍", or an admin responds with "👍" twice to the same sticker, that person will get more points.
